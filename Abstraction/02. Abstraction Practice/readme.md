# Abstraction Practice

Let's work on a prototype card game that will eventually be added to Age of Dragons.

## Assignment

Finish the `DeckOfCards` class. The `SUITS` and `RANKS` of each card have been provided for you as class variables. You won't need to modify them, but you will need to use them.

1. [ ] Complete the constructor:
   1. [ ] Initialize a `private` empty list called `cards`.
   2. [ ] Fill that empty list by calling the `create_deck` method within the constructor.
2. [ ] Complete the `create_deck(self)` method:
   1. [ ] Create a `(Rank, Suit)` **tuple** for all 52 cards in the deck and append them to the `cards` list.

Order matters! The cards should be appended to the list in the following order: all ranks of hearts, then diamonds, then clubs, and finally spades. Within each suit, the cards should be ordered from lowest rank (Ace) to highest rank (King).

3. [ ] Complete the `shuffle_deck(self)` method:
   1. [ ] Use the [random.shuffle()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle) function (available from the random package) to shuffle the `cards` in the deck.
4. [ ] Complete the `deal_card(self)` method:
   1. [ ] [.pop()](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#:~:text=list.pop,Python%20Library%20Reference.) the first card off the top of the deck (top of the deck is the *end* of the list) and return it. If there are no cards left in the deck the method should instead return `None`.
