# Inheritance Practice

You discovered that to properly calculate army formations in the game, you needed to be able to get the area and perimeter of squares and rectangles of various sizes.

## Assignment

Finish implementing the empty methods of the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes. *All squares are rectangles*, but not all rectangles are squares.

Due to inheritance of methods, the `Square` class should only need to implement the `__init__` method, which should re-use `Rectangle`’s initialization.
