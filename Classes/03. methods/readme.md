# Methods

So you might be wondering *why* classes are useful, they're like [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)... but worse... Right?

Well, no. First of all, classes provide structure. The `class` definition says "hey, I have these specific properties". A dictionary is more powerful in the sense that you can store whatever you want in it, but that also makes it less clear *what on earth is in there* at any given time.

*Another* thing that makes classes useful is that they can have [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects)! A method is just a function that's tied directly to a class and has access to its properties. See the `take_damage` method here:

```python
class Soldier:
    health = 5

    # This is a method that reduces the
    # health of the soldier
    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.health -= damage

soldier_one = Soldier()
soldier_one.take_damage(2)
print(soldier_one.health)
# prints "3"

soldier_two = Soldier()
soldier_two.take_damage(1)
print(soldier_two.health)
# prints "4"
```

## Self

Methods are defined *within* the `class` declaration. Their first parameter is always the instance of the class that the method is being called on. By convention, it's called ["self"](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method), and because `self` is a reference to the object, you can use it to read and update the properties of the object.

Notice that methods are called directly on an object instance using the dot operator:

```python
my_object.my_method()
```

## Assignment

**Complete the `fortify()` method on the wall class**. It should double the current `armor` property.
